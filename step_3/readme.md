# browser resistricts modules from being run from a file protocol
# it only allows it to be run through http or https protocol
# hence we need a serve that will serve the html file as a http page 

# > we will use a node package called "serve"
# so we run > npx serve in this folder... this package picks defaultly index.html files and serve them to our browser

# ================= this file separations in step_3 are perfectly ok for me. the step_4 is just for extra teaching ==================
