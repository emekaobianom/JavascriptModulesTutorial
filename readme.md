Javascript Modules
==================

This tutorial takes you from simple idea implementation to a well organised modularised project.


### Most Importantly

Modules work only via HTTP(s), not locally
If you try to open a web-page locally, via file:// protocol, you’ll find that import/export directives don’t work. Use a local web-server, such as static-server or use the “live server” capability of your editor, such as VS Code Live Server Extension to test modules.

#### In Steps 1 & 2
We work with a single script, hence no modules neede

#### In Steps 3 & 4
We broke the single script into files, hence we used modules.
Run these steps with this serve command from online node package "serve" like so -
```bash
npx serve
```
